A Shiny app to analyze, summarize, and visualize daily streamflow data
ðŸ’§.

This app takes advantage of bcgovâ€™s
[{fasstr}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fasstr) and
[{tidyhydat}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyhydat) packages to
allow for an interactive way to view and customize the statistics,
tables, and plots created from {fasstr}â€™s streamflow analysis functions.
More information on {fasstr} and its functions can be found on its
[GitHub Page](https://bcgov.github.io/fasstr/) and [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/bcgov/fasstr).

Also see the Excel version, [FASSTX](https://github.com/bcgov/FASSTX/),
on [GitHub](https://github.com/bcgov/FASSTX/).
