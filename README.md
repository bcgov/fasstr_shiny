A Shiny app to analyze, summarize, and visualize daily streamflow data
ðŸ’§.

This app takes advantage of bcgovâ€™s
[{tidyhydat}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyhydat) and
[{fasstr}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fasstr) packages to allow
for an interactive way to view and customize the statistics, tables, and
plots created from {fasstr}â€™s streamflow analysis functions. More
information on {fasstr} and its functions can be found on its [GitHub
Page](https://bcgov.github.io/fasstr/) and [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/bcgov/fasstr).
