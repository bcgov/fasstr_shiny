A Shiny app to analyze, summarize, and visualize daily streamflow data
üíß.

This app takes advantage of bcgov‚Äôs
[{fasstr}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fasstr) and
[{tidyhydat}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyhydat) packages to
allow for an interactive way to view and customize the statistics,
tables, and plots created from {fasstr}‚Äôs streamflow analysis functions.
More information on {fasstr} and its functions can be found on its
[GitHub Page](https://bcgov.github.io/fasstr/) and [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/bcgov/fasstr).

Also see the Excel version, [FASSTX](https://github.com/bcgov/FASSTX/),
on [GitHub](https://github.com/bcgov/FASSTX/).

### Working with {fasstrshiny}

> Here we cover how to setup `fasstrshiny` on your local computer as
> well as how to start using the code output from `fasstrshiny`

## Using `fasstrshiny`

There are several ways to use `fasstrshiny`

#### **1. Online <https://bcgov-env.shinyapps.io/fasstrshiny/>**

**Pros**

-   No need to install R or `fasstrshiny`!

**Cons**

-   Slower
-   Bookmarking uses urls which can be very long
-   Won‚Äôt be learning any new R :(

#### **2. Locally**

To install, in the R console run the following (this needs to be done
**once**)

    install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_github("bcgov/fasstrshiny")

To use HYDAT data in the app, the Environment and Climate Change
Canada‚Äôs HYDAT database must be downloaded (this needs to be done
**once** or as needed to update):

    tidyhydat::download_hydat()

To the Shiny App run, in the R console, run the following (this needs to
be done **everytime**):

    library(fasstrshiny) # Loads the package
    fasstr_shiny()       # Launches the Shiny App

**Pros**

-   Faster
-   Bookmarking uses local files so urls are simpler
-   As you‚Äôre working in R already, it‚Äôs easier to start using the
    `fasstr` code output by the Shiny App to learn more!

**Cons**

-   You need to install R, RStudio (optional but recommended), and the
    `fasstrshiny` package
-   Working locally means that your system setup may occasionally create
    unique problems that are tricky to trouble shoot (when in doubt,
    update all your packages: `remotes::update_packages()`)

## Using code output from Shiny App

Every page in this app has an ‚ÄúR Code‚Äù tab. This tab shows the R code
used to create all the plots and figures on that particular page.

Playing around with this code on your own is a great way to become more
familiar with R and fasstr.

First, if you‚Äôre brand new to R, consider running through [a primer on
getting started in R and
RStudio](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/).

Once you‚Äôre comfortable working with basic R scripts, you‚Äôre ready to
take a stab playing with fasstr code!

### Loading packages

First, you‚Äôll need to make sure you have the right packages loaded. If
you‚Äôve already installed the fasstrshiny package (as above) and have
been using fasstrshiny locally, you‚Äôre good to go. Otherwise, install
fasstr and the HYDAT database using the instructions above.

### Running fasstr code

Each series of code starts with a block loading the data
(`data_flow = ...`), either from the HYDAT data base or a local file
(see Things to remember, below if loading local data).

To run this code locally, copy all the code, and paste it into a script
in RStudio (or similar R IDE).

There is one very important step to do now: **Add `library(fasstr)` to
the top of the script**. This only needs to be done once per script, and
it‚Äôs best to put this code at the top of a script since it needs to be
loaded before any thing else.

Now you can run the script! It should produce the figures and/or output
you see in the fasstrshiny app.

> Note that some complex figures (e.g.¬†hydrographs with added dates and
> added MAD values) have been modified *after* the fasstr figure was
> produced so the code won‚Äôt reproduce those figures exactly.

Saving this script is a great way to keep track of your analyses for
future use. You can also share them with colleagues.

### Things to remember

#### **Updating code**

The R code panel generally *only* shows the last figure you produced. So
if you‚Äôre on that tab and change a setting, it won‚Äôt always be updated
in the code. To be safe, **always** look at the figure/table you want to
reproduce first, and *then* grab the code.

This also means that if you don‚Äôt look at a tab, the code won‚Äôt appear
in the R Code tab.

#### **Local data**

If you load a local data set, the R code data block will only show the
name of the file. This means that **unless your file is in your working
directory** the loading code will error. For a better understanding of
working directories, see [An Introduction to R - 1.7 Working
directories](https://intro2r.com/work-d.html).

In general, try to work with RStudio projects, and keep your scripts and
data together. If your data is in your working directory, you can run
the code as is, otherwise you‚Äôll need to modify the file name to include
a location.

For example, ‚Äútest.csv‚Äù becomes ‚Äúdata/test.csv‚Äù if I have test.csv in a
`data` folder in my working directory.

### Project Status

This project is under development. While many features are in place,
